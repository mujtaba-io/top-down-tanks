> MUST NAME YOUR Player NODES AFTER THEIR PEER IDs.
EDIT: Make sure to name all the network-enabled nodes such as
Player to be their exact multiplayer peer IDs, because RPC
calls look for nodes with same Nodepath on remote device.

So if the nodes are named corectly, the RPC call will go to 
correct node, else it will be received by another node of same
type, thus causing stutter or glitchy movement or no movement at all.
