PeersManager will be Autoload global script.


In this multiplayer architecture, we have a game instance
which can create a server. Therre will be multiple client
instances that can connect to it.

It will for a cluster of connected devices following
client-server architecture. Thus all P2P communication
will pass through server (all RPC calls).

Server will constantly listen to new clients,
and add all the joined clients' RPC IDs to `peers` array
and remove all disconnected clients from it.

Server will also trigger its own signals that can be
conected by any other script to do their task, so
UI will listen to these signals to update their state,
if player joined in-game, Level scene will use this 
to spawn in level and so on.


A server, with some clients connected will be called `cluster`.
And a cluster only has 1 server and any number of clients.

So:
	MultiplayerSystem: Set of Peers
	Peer: A game instance.
